# Whos on Twitch?

I can get all all my twitch streamers from Twitch's API and they are sorted in their respective 'All', 'Online', and 'Offline' tabs. I can search for a certain streamer under the tab I selected. I can click on them to see a streamer's home twitch page.

*Note: Twitch API will be deprecated in late 2018.*
